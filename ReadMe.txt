Point 1:
While executing cells in 
ED21S014_LAB_9_Q1_b.ipynb
in Google Colab

I have added following lines to 
allow importing of 
univariate_linear_regression.csv
from local drive.

#load .csv file from local drive into google colab 
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

Uploading of the univariate_linear_regression.csv file 
from local drive into google colab 
is verified and 
the complete code with plots is 
verified to be running fine.

Point 2:
The plot images after inclusion to this 
folder exceeded 500KB limit in moodle
hence are removed from this folder but are 
verified to be running in google colab.
